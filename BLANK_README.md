<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

DROPTASK; is a task manager app that lets you quickly input tasks and then sorts and displays it in an appropriate list for you.

Go ahead, enter in any movies you haven't gotten around to seeing yet, restaurants that are on your must-try list, hot new products that you've got your eye on or that NYT bestseller that you aspire to read one day. DROPTASK; will take care of the sorting and storing for you! 

**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you have registered, you can view all of your current tasks and add additional ones from the main page. Simply add in whatever your current task is "buy toothpaste", and iot will automatically be added to the appropriate category.

You can click on an individual task to see additional information that has been generated for each task, including an image & description. From here you can also make any edits to your task, include title and category.

Marking tasks as complete will move them to a seperate list where you can see all of your previous tasks, and deleting them will remove them completely.
